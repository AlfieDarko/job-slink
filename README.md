## Intro

This idea had come out of our company ClickCleanit losing a valuable client due to miscommunication between our company and sub-contractors regarding job details. I felt we needed more of our communications recorded and sent digitally.<br>

I then realised this is something that is faced by alot of other companies in this industry so I decided to develop a demo product that provides a solution to this problem. <br> I spoke to the other co-founders to find out what their needs was in a system like this and I developed a spec based on this.

## Spec

Our users can buy a monthly account (or use a demo account in this instance) so that they can hold all their contractor details and assign jobs via the JobSlink system.

Users can assign them manually or decide that they can let JobSlink assign them automatically, according to job acceptance rate and how close that contractor is to the job. <br> The aim is to automate job allocation in order to free up time for business owners and staff management to focus on more important tasks.

Job assignments are sent via SMS and all a contractor has to do is reply 'OK' to accept a job. <br> When the job is finished, the contractor replies 'DONE' & the job will be marked as complete on the system.

This can potentially save businesses alot of time especially when it comes to routine tasks that do not need a certain level of Owner-Contractor communication.

## Technology Used
- Javascript
- Node.JS
- Prism
- GraphQL
- React
- ESLint (Linting)
- Jest  (Testing)
- Enzyme (Testing)
- Selenium (Integration Testing)
- CodeClimate(Coverage)
- TravisCI (CI/CD)
- AWS

#### Why these?

I wanted to develop my Javascript development skills while at the same time using brand new tech that I've not used before so that it provides me with enough technical challenge to make this a great learning experience.

I've been reading alot about GraphQL as I really like how easy queries are to write compared to things like SQL. GraphQL makes it super easy to expand and manipulate info from your API. I feel like this would be a great project to test this out and keep things interesting.

After researching testing technologies for React, I decided to go with Jest & Enzyme. I had been recommended these two by various Makers Academy alumni who test and develop React web apps in production.

Using TravisCI and AWS will allow me to develop my devops skills. Being able to deploy features as part of a dev team means this is an important part I need to master.

## Installation



## Usage example



## Development setup

Describe how to install all development dependencies and how to run an automated test-suite of some kind. Potentially do this for multiple platforms.

```sh
make install
npm test
```
