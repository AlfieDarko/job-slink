# Job Slink
> Job allocation system that sends time sensitive job details to sub-contractors via SMS.

This idea had come out of our company losing clients due to miscommunication between our company and sub-contractors regarding job details. I felt we needed more of our communications recorded and sent digitally.<br><Br>

When a contractor is sent a job, they can be sent all the job details like time, address etc. via SMS or Email. We previously used to communicate this info over the phone but sometimes things can get misinterpreted and long term this leads to lower client satisfaction.<br><Br>

This project will allow me to use and experiment with brand new technology all the while using TDD and SOLID development principles
